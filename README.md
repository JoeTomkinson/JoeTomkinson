## About Me

<img align="left" alt="Gif" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17493722/187396410-415e8cf8-ffdf-4b49-b088-109ae94d9d35.gif" width="200" />

I’m a full-stack software engineer in a Head of Software Development role. I adopt the T-Model of learning so have a broad range of experience across the Microsoft stack including a number of other languages and frameworks. As part of the T-Model I specialise deeply in a few key areas; namely integration development, Cognitive Services (ML & AI), and Xamarin Development. I have years of experience in technology strategy for enterprise software development in a commercial delivery focused setting; where I have successfully led multiple teams in executing large-scale enterprise projects.

I'm also the founder of [Dev in a Box ©](https://devinabox.dev) a really simple software publisher created for distributing applications across various Microsoft Platforms. Right now this is a hobbiest organisation allowing me to still remain technically hands on and keep my own technical skills acute. Most apps can be found in the [Microsoft App Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/search?hl=en-gb&gl=GB&publisher=Dev%20in%20a%20Box) :computer:
